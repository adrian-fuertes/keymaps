# Sweep ðŸ¦€

My [Ferris Sweep](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep) keyboard uses [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/) wireless controllers which run on [ZMK](https://zmk.dev). ZMK uses Github Actions to build the keyboard's software, therefore my Sweeps's lives [here](https://github.com/adrian-fuertes/sweep), in its own repository.
